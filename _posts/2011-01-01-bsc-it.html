Specialising in Software Development. My final year project was to create a fully 3D online multiplayer game that operated in the browser. Everything was written in Javascript, the 3D graphics were created using Three.js on the client side, and on the server side Node.js was used along with Socket.IO in order to allow server push functionality. HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery were used for the web interface which initiated the game.
