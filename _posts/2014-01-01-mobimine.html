I worked on setting up an infrastructure for a mining solutions company: setting up the IIS server, working on a ASP.Net MVC web interface, and creating a C# program to seamlessly extract MySQL data, generate PDF and Excel reports, and email these to customers at certain intervals. This C# program was run as a Windows service on a Windows server in order to allow the reports to be generated and sent at the right times. The report data was extracted through the use of stored procedures and DbMetal was used to map database objects to C# objects. For the ASP.Net web interface I used HTML, CSS and Javascript to provide the web functionality.
