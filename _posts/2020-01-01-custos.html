At Custos, I was part of a 4-5 person dev team. We had a wide variety of products and services to run and maintain, so work in a typical sprint could range from doing AWS DevOps to working on a Django site to writing C++ watermarking algorithms. I picked up a tremendous amount of hands-on experience at Custos in designing, implementing and maintaining software stacks. As a small team, we had to come up with solutions to problems in many different domains, instilling the practice of learning new languages, environments and problems in order to find the best and most efficient solution. Some of my notable projects include:

<ul class="resume-list">
  <li>Porting a patented video watermarking algorithm from Python to C++</li>
  <li>Setting up our own Bitcoin Blockexplorer node running on AWS</li>
  <li>Designing and implementing the architecture for a video platform with AWS Cloudformation</li>
</ul>
