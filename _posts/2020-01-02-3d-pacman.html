Final year project with the requirement to make a multiplayer version of Pac-Man.
I implemented the game using Three.js on the client and a Node.js server.
I used WebSockets to allow seamlessly playing over a network, with each player sending a small JSON object containing their current movements, and the server broadcasting to keep everyone in sync. The game pits 2 or more
Pac-Man players against 4 ghost players, and adds some skills to balance out the scales.
