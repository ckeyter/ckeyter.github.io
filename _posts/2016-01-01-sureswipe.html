I worked for SureSwipe mainly as a Javascript web developer, using the Meteor.js framework. My responsibilities included everything from designing and building apps with HTML, CSS & Javascript to coding Java servers and web services to managing MongoDB and SQL databases. During my time with the company I started a small project to create an app to help the service technicians with their daily work orders. This app turned out to be very successful and greatly improved the day-to-day performance of its users. The app was eventually released country wide across all of the company's branches, with all of the technicians being issued tablets specifically to use this app.
