I joined SLVRCLD at a very early stage in the company, and was responsible for designing and building the entire tech stack. We had some great challenges, like needing an extendable data pipeline of product and quote information for almost every product imaginable, and then performing complex replacement calculations in real-time via our API. Being able to design and build such a complex system out of nothing is quite a rare pleasure, and gave me an entirely new level of insight and knowledge. We decided early on to use Python and AWS as much as possible, which was critical in allowing our small team to build and iterate within the given timeframes.

After a series of unfortunate events, I was also tasked with building the entire front-end in React, running as a thin client over our Python-powered GraphQL API. This unlocked many more valuable lessons in terms of API design, and using reusable components like Tailwind to build the website with a speed and quality I could only have dreamed of back in the early days of web development. Overall, my work here made me keenly aware of the ever growing potential of modern technology and small teams, and only served to deepen my love affair with Python.
