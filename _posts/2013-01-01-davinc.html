For this project, JSP and Javascript was used to create a web interface and there was an interesting challenge of creating an interface to display real-time graphs of a constant stream of electrical data in the browser, where performance testing and optimisation was very important. The data was pulled from a MySQL database and accessed with Java code on the server side, where it was parsed into JSON in order to send it efficiently over to the client-side JavaScript code.
