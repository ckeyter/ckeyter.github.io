I am a software developer from South Africa who loves designing and implementing elegant software. I love creating great products that work on every level - from the ease of use of the interface, to the simplicity of the code, to the efficiency of the architecture. I am fascinated by the many intricacies of the software design and implementation process, and I can't help but want to whittle that product down and smooth out the edges until everything feels right. I enjoy working on teams who are open to remote working and share a drive to put good software out there. I particularly enjoy the iterative process of designing software and coming up with solutions to problems, and working as a team to execute our designs as effectively as possible with proper test coverage and planning.

I love making games. I consider game development to be the ultimate art form. The marriage of art, music, writing and code to create an interactive (often personal) experience is something I've been obsessed with for as long as I can remember. I started making games with a friend at the age of 16, and have been building games since then, while trying to get into full-time game development. I've put together a small game in this website as a code audition of sorts. To play it, click the logo on the home page.
